= Homebrew Yet Another AWS SSO 

== Description

For installing https://github.com/victorskl/yawsso[Yet Another AWS SSO] for syncing up a AWS CLI v2 SSO login session to legacy CLI v1 credentials.

I created this formula because I prefer to install my tooling with Homebrew, not `pip`, as `pip` is unreliable when you have multiple `venvs`, blah blah blah you know the deal.

Worth noting that `yawsso` is only required because of https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/5455[this issue] in the AWS CDK Project.   

== Installation

. `brew tap systemmanic/yawsso`
. `brew install yawsso`

You can verify installation by running:

`yawsso -h`
